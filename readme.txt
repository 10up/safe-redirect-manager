Safely and easily manage your websites HTTP redirects.

== Description ==

Safe Redirect Manager is a very basic redirect manager for WordPress. An easy-to-use UI allows you to add locations, redirect paths, and HTTP status codes. The plugin uses the wp\_safe\_redirect function which only allows redirects to whitelisted hosts for security purposes. The plugin will automatically whitelist hosts as necessary.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
