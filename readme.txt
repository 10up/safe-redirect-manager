Safely and easily manage your website's HTTP redirects.

== Description ==

Safe Redirect Manager is a HTTP redirect manager for WordPress. An easy-to-use UI allows you to redirect locations to new URL's with the HTTP status codes of your choosing. The plugin uses the wp_safe_redirect function which only allows redirects to whitelisted hosts for security purposes. The plugin automatically handles whitelisting hosts for you.

[Fork the plugin on GitHub.](https://github.com/tlovett1/Safe-Redirect-Manager)

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

== Screenshots ==

1. This view shows all your redirects. You can filter them by date or even search through them.
2. This is the edit redirect page. Specify a "from" path, "to" path/URL, and a status code. You can schedule redirects for later dates just like posts.
